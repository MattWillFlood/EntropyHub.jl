# EntropyHub
__*An Open-Source Toolkit For Entropic Time Series Analysis*__

## Introduction

This toolkit provides a wide range of functions to calculate different entropy statistics. 
There is an ever-growing range of information-theoretic and dynamical systems entropy measures presented in the scientific literature. The goal of **EntropyHub.jl** is to integrate the many established entropy methods in one open-source package with an extensive documentation and consistent syntax [that is also accessible in multiple programming languages ([Matlab](https://www.entropyhub.xyz/matlab/EHmatlab.html), [Python](https://www.entropyhub.xyz/python/EHpython.html))].


### About 

Information and uncertainty can be regarded as two sides of the same coin: 
the more uncertainty there is, the more information we gain by removing that 
uncertainty. In the context of information and probability theory, **Entropy** 
quantifies that uncertainty. 

Various measures have been derived 
to estimate entropy (uncertainty) from discrete time series, each seeking to 
best capture the uncertainty of the system under examination. This has resulted 
in many entropy statistics from approximate entropy and sample entropy, to
multiscale sample entropy and refined-composite multiscale cross-sample entropy.

The goal of EntropyHub is to provide a comprehensive set of functions with a simple and 
consistent syntax that allows the user to augment parameters at the command 
line, enabling a range from basic to advanced entropy methods to be implemented
with ease.

!!! warning "NOTE:"
    It is important to clarify that the entropy functions herein described estimate entropy 
    in the context of probability theory and information theory as defined by Shannon, 
    and not thermodynamic or other entropies from classical physics.

## Function List

EntropyHub functions fall into 5 categories: 

* `Base`                functions for estimating the entropy of a single univariate time series.
* `Cross`               functions for estimating the entropy between two univariate time series.
* `Bidimensional`       functions for estimating the entropy of a two-dimensional univariate matrix.
* `Multiscale`          functions for estimating the multiscale entropy of a single univariate time series using any of the Base entropy functions.
* `Multiscale Cross`    functions for estimating the multiscale entropy between two univariate time series using any of the Cross-entropy functions.
